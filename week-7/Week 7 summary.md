## Balanced search tree (AVL Tree)

**Binary search tree**

* find(), insert() and delete() all walk down a single path

* Worst-case: height of the tree An unbalanced tree with $n$ nodes may have height $O(n)$

**AVL Tree**

* Balanced trees have height $O(log n)$

* Using rotations, we can maintain height balance

* Height balanced trees have height $O(log n)$

* find(), insert() and delete() all walk down a single path, take time $O(log n)$
* Minimum number of node $S(h) = S(h-2) + S(h-1) + 1$
* Maximum number of nodes $2^h - 1$

**Implementation**

```python
class AVLTree:
    # Constructor:
    def __init__(self,initval=None):
        self.value = initval
        if self.value:
            self.left = AVLTree()
            self.right = AVLTree()
            self.height = 1
        else:
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.height = 0
        return

    def isempty(self):
        return (self.value == None)

    def isleaf(self):
        return (self.value != None and self.left.isempty() and self.right.isempty())

    def leftrotate(self):
        v = self.value
        vr = self.right.value
        tl = self.left
        trl = self.right.left
        trr = self.right.right
        newleft = AVLTree(v)
        newleft.left = tl
        newleft.right = trl
        self.value = vr
        self.right = trr
        self.left = newleft
        return

    def rightrotate(self):
        v = self.value
        vl = self.left.value
        tll = self.left.left
        tlr = self.left.right
        tr = self.right
        newright = AVLTree(v)
        newright.left = tlr
        newright.right = tr
        self.right = newright
        self.value = vl
        self.left = tll
        return


    def insert(self,v):
#  will be added after graded deadline  
                              
    def rebalance(self):
#  will be added after graded deadline     
        
    def inorder(self):
        if self.isempty():
            return([])
        else:
            return(self.left.inorder()+ [self.value]+ self.right.inorder())
    def preorder(self):
        if self.isempty():
            return([])
        else:
            return([self.value] + self.left.preorder()+  self.right.preorder())
    def postorder(self):
        if self.isempty():
            return([])
        else:
            return(self.left.postorder()+ self.right.postorder() + [self.value])

A = AVLTree()
nodes = eval(input())
for i in nodes:
    A.insert(i)

print(A.inorder())
print(A.preorder())
print(A.postorder())
```

**Sample Input**

```python
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] #order of insertion
```

**Output**

```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] #inorder traversal
[4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 7] #preorder traversal
[1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 6, 4] #postorder traveral
```





## Greedy Algorithm

* Need to make a sequence of choices to achieve a global optimum 
* At each stage, make the next choice based on some local criterion 
* Never go back and revise an earlier decision 
* Drastically reduces space to search for solutions 
* Greedy strategy needs a proof of optimality
* Example :
    * Dijkstra's
    * Prim's
    * Kruskal's
    * Interval scheduling
    * Minimize lateness
    * Huffman coding



### Interval scheduling

**Scenario example**

‚ñ™ IIT Madras has a special video classroom for delivering online  lectures 

‚ñ™ Different teachers want to book the classroom 

‚ñ™ Slots may overlap, so not all bookings can be honored 

‚ñ™ Choose a subset of bookings to maximize the number of teachers  who get to use the room 



**Algorithm**

1. Sort all jobs which based on end time in increasing order.
2. Take the interval which has earliest finish time.
3. Repeat next two steps till you process all jobs.
4. Eliminate all intervals which have start time less than selected interval‚Äôs end time.
5. If interval has start time greater than current interval‚Äôs end time, at it to set. Set current interval to new interval.



**Implementation**

```python
#will be available after graded deadline
```



**Example**

In the table below, we have 8 activities with the corresponding start and finish times, It might not be possible to complete all the activities since their time frame can conflict. For example, if any activity starts at time 0 and finishes at time 4, then other activities can not start before 4. It can be started at 4 or afterwards.

What is the maximum number of activities which can be performed without conflict?

| Activity | Start time | Finish time |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| A        | 1          | 2           |
| B        | 3          | 4           |
| C        | 0          | 6           |
| D        | 1          | 4           |
| E        | 4          | 5           |
| F        | 5          | 9           |
| G        | 9          | 11          |
| H        | 8          | 10          |

### Minimize lateness

**Scenario example**

‚ñ™ IIT Madras has a single 3D  printer 

‚ñ™ A number of users need to use  this printer 

‚ñ™ Each user will get access to the  printer, but may not finish before  deadline 

‚ñ™ Goal is to minimize the lateness 

**Algorithm**

1. Sort all job in ascending order of deadlines
2. Start with time t = 0
3. For each job in the list
    1. Schedule the job at time t
    2. Finish time = t + processing time of job
    3. t = finish time
4. Return (start time, finish time) for each job



**Implementation**

```python
from operator import itemgetter
 
def minimize_lateness(jobs):
    schedule =[]
    max_lateness = 0
    t = 0
     
    sorted_jobs = sorted(jobs,key=itemgetter(2))
     
    for job in sorted_jobs:
        job_start_time = t
        job_finish_time = t + job[1]
 
        t = job_finish_time
        if(job_finish_time > job[2]):
            max_lateness =  max (max_lateness, (job_finish_time - job[2]))
        schedule.append((job[0],job_start_time, job_finish_time))
 
    return max_lateness, schedule
 
jobs = [(1, 3, 6), (2, 2, 9), (3, 1, 8), (4, 4, 9), (5, 3, 14), (6, 2, 15)]
max_lateness, sc = minimize_lateness(jobs)
print ("Maximum lateness is :" + str(max_lateness))
for t in sc:
    print ('JobId= {0}, start time= {1}, finish time= {2}'.format(t[0],t[1],t[2]))

```

**Output**

```python
Maximum lateness is :1
JobId= 1, start time= 0, finish time= 3
JobId= 3, start time= 3, finish time= 4
JobId= 2, start time= 4, finish time= 6
JobId= 4, start time= 6, finish time= 10
JobId= 5, start time= 10, finish time= 13
JobId= 6, start time= 13, finish time= 15
```



### Huffman Algorithm

**Algorithm**

1. Calculate the frequency of each character in the string.
2. Sort the characters in increasing order of the frequency.
3. Make each unique character as a leaf node.
4. Create an empty node z. Assign the minimum frequency to the left child of z and assign the second minimum frequency to the right child of z. Set the value of the z as the sum of the above two minimum frequencies.
5. Remove these two minimum frequencies from Q and add the sum into the list of frequencies.
6. Insert node z into the tree.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all the characters.
8. For each non-leaf node, assign 0 to the left edge and 1 to the right edge.



**Example**

**Implementation**

```python

class Node:
    def __init__(self,frequency,symbol = None,left = None,right = None):
        self.frequency = frequency
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# Solution        
        
def Huffman(s):
    huffcode = {}
    char = list(s)
    freqlist = []
    unique_char = set(char)
    for c in unique_char:
        freqlist.append((char.count(c),c))
    nodes = []
    for nd in sorted(freqlist):
        nodes.append((nd,Node(nd[0],nd[1])))
    while len(nodes) > 1:
        nodes.sort()
        L = nodes[0][1]
        R = nodes[1][1]
        newnode = Node(L.frequency + R.frequency, L.symbol + R.symbol,L,R)
        nodes.pop(0)
        nodes.pop(0)
        nodes.append(((L.frequency + R.frequency, L.symbol + R.symbol),newnode))

    for ch in unique_char:
        temp = newnode
        code = ''
        while ch != temp.symbol:           
            if ch in temp.left.symbol:
                code += '0'
                temp = temp.left
            else:
                code += '1'
                temp = temp.right
        huffcode[ch] = code   
    return huffcode



s = 'abbcaaaabbcdddeee'
res = Huffman(s)
for char in sorted(res):
    print(char,res[char])
```

**Output**

```
a 10
b 01
c 110
d 111
e 00
```





**Analysis**

* At each recursive step, extract letters with minimum frequency and  replace by composite letter with combined frequency 
* Store frequencies in an array  
* Linear scan to find minimum values 
* |ùê¥| = ùëò, number of recursive calls is $k ‚Äì 1 $
* Complexity is $ùëÇ(ùëò^2 )$
* Instead, maintain frequencies in an heap 
* Extracting two minimum frequency letters and adding back compound  letter are both $ùëÇ(log ùëò) $
* Complexity drops to $ùëÇ(k log ùëò)$
